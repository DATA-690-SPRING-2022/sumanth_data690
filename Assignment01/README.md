## PROJECTS
### Hand Gesture Recognition System
A machine learning project

- The aim of this project is to develop an interactive
interface that captures an image of a hand gesture and
correctly predicts and displays the letter that the hand
gesture represents. This tool can help ameliorate the
problems faced by the Individuals with speaking and
hearing disabilities.

- The images captured from the web camera are initially
transformed, following this, the features based on which
the model is trained are extracted, and an accurate
prediction of the hand gesture is made and the same is
displayed. The predictions are made based on 3 different
machine learning algorithms used to train the data,
namely, Support Vector Machines, K-Nearest Neighbors,
and Logistic Regression.
### Smart Farming Robot
A embedded project

- Designed and build a robot car to plant seeds in the field.
The prototype detects the path automatically and plants
the seeds.

- The robot detects the water content in the soil and spills
water while panting if needed.
### Duel Tone Multi Frequency Controlled Home Automation System

A IOT project

- The main principle of this project is to control appliances
like light and fan using DTMF technology.

- When a button is pressed from mobile it generates a tone
which is decoded by the decoder IC and it is sent to
ATMEGA8 controller. Controller then checks for input and
it produces the output according to the code written to it.
## ACHIEVEMENTS AND CERTIFICATIONS
### 100% scholarship
- Awarded 100% Scholarship for the
Academic session 2017-2018 in
Amity University Rajasthan.
### Embedded and Robotic workshop
- Learned to interface ICs and
program the microcontrollers using
embedded C.
### Internet Of Things workshop
- Discussed the importance and scope
of IoT in our daily routine and learned
the ways to implement it.
